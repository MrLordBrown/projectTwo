	<h2>Fire</h2>
	<p><em>Fire</em> is one of the four classical elements in ancient Greek philosophy and science. It was commonly associated with the qualities of energy, assertiveness, and passion. In one Greek myth, Prometheus stole <em>fire</em> from the gods to protect the otherwise helpless humans, but was punished for this charity.</p>

	<h2>Water</h2>
	<p><em>Water</em> was one of many archai proposed by the Pre-socratics, most of whom tried to reduce all things to a single substance. However, Empedocles of Acragas (c. 495 – c. 435 BC) selected four archai for his four roots: <em>air, fire, water, and earth</em>. Empedocles roots became the four classical elements of Greek philosophy. Plato (427–347 BC) took over the four elements of Empedocles. In the Timaeus, his major cosmological dialogue, the Platonic solid associated with  is the icosahedron which is formed from twenty equilateral triangles. This makes  <em>water</em> the element with the greatest number of sides, which Plato regarded as appropriate because  <em>water</em> flows out of one's hand when picked up, as if it is made of tiny little balls.</p>

	<h2>Air</h2>
	<p>According to Plato, <em>air</em> is associated with the octahedron; <em>air</em> is considered to be both hot and wet. The ancient Greeks used two words for <em>air</em>: aer meant the dim lower atmosphere, and aether meant the bright upper atmosphere above the clouds. Plato, for instance writes that "So it is with <em>air</em>: there is the brightest variety which we call aether, the muddiest which we call mist and darkness, and other kinds for which we have no name...." Among the early Greek Pre-Socratic philosophers, Anaximenes (mid-6th century BCE) named <em>air</em> as the arche. A similar belief was attributed by some ancient sources to Diogenes Apolloniates (late 5th century BCE), who also linked <em>air</em> with intelligence and soul (psyche), but other sources claim that his arche was a substance between <em>air</em> and fire. Aristophanes parodied such teachings in his play The Clouds by putting a prayer to <em>air</em> in the mouth of Socrates.</p>

	<h2>Earth</h2>
	<p><em>Earth</em> is one of the four classical elements in ancient Greek philosophy and science. It was commonly associated with qualities of heaviness, matter and the terrestrial world. Due to the hero cults, and chthonic underworld deities, the element of <em>earth</em> is also associated with the sensual aspects of both life and death in later occultism.</p>

	<h2>Elements</h2>
	<p>Classical elements typically refer to the concepts of earth, water, air, fire, and (later) aether, which were proposed to explain the nature and complexity of all matter in terms of simpler substances. Ancient cultures in Persia, Greece, Babylonia, Japan, Tibet, and India had similar lists, sometimes referring in local languages to "air" as "wind" and the fifth element as "void". The Chinese Wu Xing system lists Wood (木 mù), Fire (火 huǒ), Earth (土 tǔ), Metal (金 jīn), and Water (水 shuǐ), though these are described more as energies or transitions rather than as types of material.</p>
